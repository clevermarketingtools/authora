Authora is an example of an Author Graph, derived from the Common Crawl Foundation's 2010 dataset.

At the time, the 2012 data was not available.

It's built in Python, using MongoDB, Sentry on AWS, and released under an Apache License.

Originally we hoped to open source it and enter it in the Common Crawl Foundation's competition.

Now it's finally getting to see the light of day.

Stay tuned for better documentation.
